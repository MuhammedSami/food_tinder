# Food Tinder

This backend is designed to support a lightweight, anonymous, swipe-based product voting experience that is intended to collect feedback on food items available inside Foodji-style machines.


## Usage Scenario

- A user encounters a machine that offers food products.

- The operator wants to collect feedback on how appealing these products are.

- Instead of requiring accounts or authentication, the user provides feedback anonymously through a simple swipe interaction.

## How users access the voting flow

- Users are shown a QR code near the machine.

- Scanning the QR code directs the user to a web-app where voting begins.
